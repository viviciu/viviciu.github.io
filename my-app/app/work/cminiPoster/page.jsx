            I found myself enjoying this project more than I’d expected. I got
            out of my comfort zone this project (and year overall) by asking for
            as much critical feedback as I could. It made the work harder
            because all its shortcomings became apparent, but I’ve consistently
            found it’s the 1-1 moments where I have the biggest breakthroughs.
            Not asking for help and crit means staying ignorant—one of the most
            beautiful things about design school is crit. It’s a privilege you
            can’t have that anywhere else.
            <br />
            <br />
            Apart from personal development, I learned that the fundamentals of
            hierarchy—scale, proximity, alignment, color, contrast, stroke
            weight, enter/exit—are incredibly powerful, and should be used in
            moderation and with careful intention. Less is more.
            <br />
            <br />
            Writing out what my five senses detected during my event helped me
            understand the visceral emotions encapsulating the race. Along with
            interviewing spectators and racers, (“What brought you here? How did
            you find out?”), you cannot skip understanding your audience and
            what you aim to communicate to them (appeal of climbing 13 hills) to
            meet a specific goal (attracting participants). We understand this
            as the “Familiarization” phase. Having structure to this project
            with the Familiarize, Develop, Refine and the medium prompts was
            incredibly helpful for me to find security in my process and not go
            backwards.
            <br />
            <br />I also learned that the way image and grid influences a
            composition is a form of hierarchy in itself. An image can combat
            communication or type in two ways: 1. It sends the wrong
            connotations, or 2. It’s composition influences the enter/exit or
            read of a page in a direction that fights the typographic hierarchy.
            Choosing an image first and evaluating what it speaks to your
            intended audience cannot be overlooked. I learned that if you’re
            image-making, considering how a graphic will fit with information in
            tandem is very important to avoid conflicting contrasts or flow is
            key. That information should be already has established which
            content goes with what, and in which order.
