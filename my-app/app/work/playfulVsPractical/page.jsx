            Inspired by a lamp post on campus and the familiar gestures we
            conjure from hearing music, this study reflects a playful yet
            precise object. It is one that incites methodical exploration over
            immediate understanding. It traces the evolution of a relationship
            through the initial spark of curiosity, the uncertainty of trial and
            error, and ultimate delight of learning something foreign.

            Exploring the material relationships between elastic band and wood,
            design a sensible working object that has playful or practical
            device-like characteristics. Unite form studies to determine the
            appropriate look, feel, make, and performance of the device. The
            models do not have to work, but must allow us to imagine so without
            distraction and interruption.
            <br />
            <br />
            How do the pieces of this device come together as a whole making a
            satisfying interaction? The working nature of the device derives
            itself from the properties, characteristics, look, and feel of
            material.

                Actually holding the parts in 3D space raises opportunities to
                connect, dismantle, and discover new proportional relationships.
                Sometimes this can be distracting as I&apos;m constantly tempted
                to diverge from the plan with the allure of the &quot;what
                ifs&quot;, the potential of a new idea. To me, ideas are time
                sensitive. You can&apos;t let them run away, so at times process
                models become mutilated as I try to bring new ideas to life on

              An object that isn&apos;t quick to understand is something I used
              to think was a poor design. This piece taught me that objects can
              act as a violins: only through exploration, play, and some
              teaching one is able to handle it with grace. Not everything is or
              should be intuitive. This piece traces the evolution of a
              relationship through the initial spark of curiosity, the
              uncertainty of trial and error, and ultimate delight of learning
              something foreign.

              In the beginning, I felt every single decision had to be backed by
              specific logic. While this is true to an extent, ignoring
              intuition only held me back from committing to what I truly felt
              was strong. There&apos;s incredible value to what your hands and
              eyes can tell you without words. This project was an exercise not
              only in taking a functional, rubber-band form into a model that
              conveys the movement without elastic function, but a trust
              exercise. A style exercise.

          In the everyday, sometimes I imagine how I might interact with the
          static forms in the world around me—as if I could bend, hinge, or
          extrude fascinating forms. I wonder what context the form could live
          in and who they might serve.

          This lamp on campus inspired my initial elastic band working model. I
          thought: What if I could put my hand on top, and methodically rotate
          it laterally?

          The negative space from my original form brought me back to refine it.
          Compared to the desktop model, the negative space and handheld nature
          gave rise to a novel instrument, one which affords an opportunity to
          explore a foreign interaction.
          <br />

          from learning something new.
          <br />
          <br />I angled the paddle as I noticed my wrists natrually want to
          rotate like turning a doorknob, improving ergonomics. The concave wood
          paddle affords a place for users to rest their fingers in.

          Designing the entire experience starts from before the user is aware
          of its presence—how does one approach it? Pick it up? The moment you
          pick up a form influences the way you might interact with it and needs
          consideration.
          <br />
          <br />
          Starting with a clay counterform to inform me of what shapes the
          intented grip creates, I then shaved away what was not essential to
          give just enough info of how to pick it up.

          Widening the palm-facing side and extending subtle edges pointed
          towards the head of the form, indicating where your other hand should
          interact.

            From testing prototypes with my peers, I found the top styrene
            &apos;hood&apos; was found uncessesary to the essence of the grip.
            Thus, only the tapered pointing arrows, like hands, directed the
            eyes towards the wooden paddle for the other hand to rest.
