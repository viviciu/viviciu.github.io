              Joining the team I only had some html and css background
              self-taught during highschool—but I still wanted to be involved in
              the building of the site after the design stage to ensure
              it&apos;s execution follows the vision. Through Blender tutorials,
              reading documentation, and looking towards well-structured codepen
              examples, I learned React and React Three Fiber to help build our
              site using 3D scenes.

              Notational Sketching practices developed over freshman year
              heavily influenced my process collaborating in teams. It allowed
              me to quickly communicate to another dev a simpler approach to
              programming the 3D infinitely rotating planes on the Home page. I
              took on programming and styling the texture of the Home page and
              frosted cursor.

              Creative—a team of over 40 students across different

              influences during cross-team meetings and weekly general body
              meetings—where each team shared their progress—made me prioritize
              the team and theme&apos;s direction in every design decision.

          text2="Unfortunately, since the 3.js textures of the glass panels of the home page were extremely heavy, we had to settle for a more optimized version—still to which had performance issues. I learned it's key to test assets to production-grade fidelity live as early as the design stages, to see if a concept can be well executed by the devs far ahead of launch date. This also calls for transparency between devs and designers as to what truly can be done in our timeline. The navigation UX had also become an issue: We gave no affordances on how to really enter the site or what was clickable // hoverable. This served the artistic theme well, but not the users. If we stray too far from familiarity and usability becomes lost, the artistic concept of the work becomes lost along with it."
