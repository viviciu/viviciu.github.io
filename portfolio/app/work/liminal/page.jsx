            Lunar Gala (LG) is Pittsburgh&apos;s largest annual fashion show.
            It&apos;s website features the model lines, members, and ticketing
            all in line with this year&apos;s visual identity: <i>Liminality</i>
            .
            <br /> <br /> I designed and developed the site&apos;s home page,
            and conceptualized the lines page. Working amongst 7 others, I
            learned to communicate with devs, create concept renderings, and
            program interactive prototypes for our Creative Directors using
            React Three Fiber.
            <br /> <br />
            We encountered challenges with members ghosting and optimization
            issues, but managed to release on-time, garnering 250+ attendees for
            the final show.

            After recieving the Creative Director&apos;s theme, Liminal, we had
            to establish constraints. How does LG{" "}

            Liminality? How does that{" "}

              We define Liminality as &quot;neither here nor there,&quot; a

              Our challenge was to achieve Liminality through the form,
              function, and interaction of the website. Weekly Creative Team
              meetings directed our visual identity as the website had to stay
              cohesive with the interpretations that Print, Motion, and
              Photography sub-teams were developing in their work.
